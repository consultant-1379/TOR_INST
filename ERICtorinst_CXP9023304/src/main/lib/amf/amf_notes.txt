Assignment State
  • UNASSIGNED:
    a service instance is said to be unassigned if no service unit has the active or quiescing HA state
    for this service instance.
  • FULLY_ASSIGNED:
    A service instance is said to be fully-assigned if and only if
    • the number of service units having the active or quiescing HA state for the
      service instance is equal to the preferred number of active assignments for
      the service instance, which is defined in the redundancy model of the corresponding service group
    and
    • the number of service units having the standby HA state for the service
      instance is equal to the preferred number of standby assignments for the service instance, which is defined in
      the redundancy model of the corresponding service group
  • PARTIALLY_ASSIGNED: a configured service instance that is neither unassigned nor
    fully-assigned is said to be partially-assigned.

Presence State
  • UNINSTANTIATED
  • INSTANTIATING
  • INSTANTIATED
  • TERMINATING
  • RESTARTING
  • INSTANTIATION-FAILED
  • TERMINATION-FAILED


Administrative State
  • UNLOCKED:
    The service unit has not been directly prohibited from taking service instance assignments by the administrator.
  • LOCKED:
    The administrator has prevented the service unit from taking service instance assignments.
  • LOCKED-INSTANTIATION:
    The administrator has prevented the service unit from being instantiated by the Availability Management Framework;
    the service unit is then not instantiable.
  • SHUTTING-DOWN:
    The administrator has prevented the service unit from taking new service instance assignments and requested
    that existing service instance assignments be gracefully removed.
    When all service instances assigned to the service unit have finally been removed,
    its administrative state becomes locked.


Operational State
  • enabled: the operational state of a service unit transitions from disabled to enabled when a successful repair action has been performed on the service unit
  • disabled: the operational state of a service unit transitions to disabled if a component of the service unit has transitioned to the disabled state and the Availability Management Framework has taken a recovery action at the level of the entire service unit.

Readiness State

  OUT-OF-SERVICE
    The readiness state of a non-pre-instantiable service unit is out-of-service if  one or more of the following conditions are met:
      • its operational state or the operational state of its containing node is disabled;
      • its administrative state or the administrative state of its containing service group, AMF node, application, or the cluster is either locked or lockedinstantiation;
      • the CLM node to which the containing AMF node is mapped is not a member.

    The readiness state of a pre-instantiable service unit is out-of-service if
      • any of the preceding conditions that cause a non-pre-instantiable service unit to become out-of-service is true,
      • or its presence state is neither instantiated nor restarting,
      • or the service unit contains contained components, and their configured
      container CSI is not assigned active or quiescing to any container component on the node that contains the service unit.

    When the readiness state of a service unit is out-of-service, no new service
    instance can be assigned to it. If service instances are already assigned to the
    service unit at the time when the service unit enters the out-of-service state, they
    are transferred to other service units (if possible) and removed.

    Note that in some cases, pre-instantiable service units may be instantiated while
    they are out-of-service. However, non-pre-instantiable service units are terminated when they transition to the
      out-of-service readiness state.

  IN-SERVICE
    The readiness state of a non-pre-instantiable service unit is in-service if all of the following conditions are met:
      • its operational state and the operational state of its containing node is enabled;
      • its administrative state and the administrative states of its containing service group, AMF node, application, and the cluster are unlocked;
      • the CLM node to which the containing AMF node is mapped is a member

    The readiness state of a pre-instantiable service unit is in-service if
      • all of the preceding conditions that cause a non-pre-instantiable service unit to become in-service are true,
      • and its presence state is either instantiated or restarting,
      • and the configured container CSI of all contained components of the service unit is assigned active to at least one container component on the
      node that contains the service unit.

    When a service unit is in the in-service readiness state, it is eligible for service
    instance assignments; however, it is possible that it has not yet been assigned
    any service instance.

  STOPPING
    The readiness state of a service unit is stopping if all of the following conditions  are met:
      • its operational state and the operational state of its containing node is enabled,
      • none of the administrative states of itself, the containing service group,
        AMF node, application, CLM node, or the cluster is locked or locked-instantiation,
      • at least one of the administrative states of itself, the containing service
        group, AMF node, application, CLM node, or the cluster is shutting-down,
        or the container component which is handling the life cycle of contained
        components of the service unit has the quiescing HA state for the container
        CSI of the contained components, and the CLM node to which the containing AMF node
        is mapped is a member node.

    When a service unit is in the stopping state, no service instance can be assigned
    to it, but already assigned service instances are not removed until the service
    unit's components indicate to do so.
